# Project Motivation

For this project, I was interested in using Stack Overflow survey data from various years to better understand:

  1. If data science is a trending job. How is evolving the share of data scientists along the years.
  2. What distinguishes data scientists from other developers. What are the technological competencies and educational differences from those subpopulations.
  3. How theese differences translates into salary.
